# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on the user's input by analyzing similarities between movies using a dataset containing movie information. The recommendation is based on genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.

## Introduction

A movie recommendation system aims to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy. This system uses text-based data like genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors from a movie dataset. By processing this data, the system identifies similarities between different movies and provides recommendations accordingly.

## Data Collection and Pre-Processing

1. **Loading the Dataset:**  
   The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file (`movies.csv`). This dataset contains information about various movies, including their genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and directors.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**  
   Any missing values in the selected features (`genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, `director`) are replaced with an empty string. This ensures the model can process the data without encountering errors due to `NaN` values.

## Feature Extraction

1. **Combining Relevant Features:**  
   The selected features (`genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, `director`) are combined into a single string for each movie. This combination creates a consolidated text that contains all the relevant information needed for comparison.

2. **Converting Text Data to Feature Vectors:**  
   The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer from `scikit-learn` is used to convert the combined text data into numerical feature vectors. This helps in representing the importance of different words in relation to the movies.

## Cosine Similarity Calculation

1. **Calculating Cosine Similarity:**  
   Cosine Similarity is used to measure the similarity between the feature vectors. It computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a similarity score between 0 and 1. A score closer to 1 indicates high similarity between two movies.

2. **Creating the Similarity Matrix:**  
   Using the feature vectors generated by the TF-IDF Vectorizer, a similarity matrix is created where each element represents the similarity score between two movies.

## Finding Similar Movies

1. **Getting User Input:**  
   The user is prompted to enter their favorite movie. This input is then used to find the closest matching movie title in the dataset.

2. **Finding Closest Match:**  
   The `difflib` library is used to find close matches for the user's input movie title from the list of movie titles in the dataset.

3. **Retrieving Similar Movies:**  
   Once the closest matching movie is identified, the system retrieves its index and computes the similarity scores of all movies relative to the chosen one. The movies are then sorted based on their similarity scores in descending order.

## How to Use the Recommendation System

1. **Run the Python Script:**  
   Execute the script in a Python environment that has all the required dependencies installed.

2. **Enter Your Favorite Movie:**  
   When prompted, enter the name of your favorite movie.

3. **View Movie Recommendations:**  
   The system will display a list of movies that are similar to the one you entered, ranked by similarity.

## Conclusion

This Movie Recommendation System provides an efficient way to find movies similar to a user's favorite by leveraging text-based features and calculating cosine similarity scores. It can be further enhanced by incorporating more complex models or additional features like user ratings, reviews, or metadata.

Feel free to customize this system or extend it with additional features!
